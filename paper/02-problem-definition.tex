\chapter{Problem Definition} \label{chap:problem_definition}

Scheduling is a fundamental problem in operations research and computer science, pivotal for optimizing resource utilization across various industries such as manufacturing, logistics, and computing. Efficient scheduling ensures that tasks are completed in a timely manner while minimizing costs and maximizing productivity.

In this thesis, we focus on a specific variant of the scheduling problem characterized by \textbf{local precedence constraints}. Unlike global precedence constraints, which require a strict ordering of tasks across all machines, local precedence constraints mandate that the precedence order is adhered to only within each individual machine based on a predefined global order of jobs. This distinction allows for greater flexibility in scheduling, as jobs can be assigned to different machines without violating the local precedence requirements, provided that the order of jobs on each machine respects the global job ordering.
