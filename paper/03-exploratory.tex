\chapter{Exploratory Analysis}\label{ch:exploratory-analysis}

This chapter presents the exploratory analysis conducted to evaluate the performance of various scheduling algorithms under local precedence constraints. By systematically experimenting with different algorithms and instance generators, we aim to identify the most effective strategies for minimizing the total weighted sum of completion times. The analysis seeks to uncover each algorithm's strengths and weaknesses across diverse job weight distributions and machine configurations. The following sections detail the experimental setup and provide comprehensive definitions of the algorithms under consideration.
