\chapter{Theory}

\begin{markdown}
**List of Results**
- **Theoretical Analysis:**
  - Present any new theoretical findings or proofs.
  - Example: Derive approximation ratios for the greedy or other heuristic algorithms.
- **Performance Bounds:**
  - Establish upper and lower bounds on algorithm performance.
  - Discuss conditions under which these bounds hold.
- **Algorithm Properties:**
  - Prove properties such as convergence, correctness, or optimality under specific
    circumstances.
- **Relation to Observations:**
  - Connect theoretical results with experimental data.
  - Explain discrepancies between theoretical expectations and empirical findings.
