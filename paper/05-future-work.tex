**Potential Extensions:**
- **Algorithmic Improvements:**
  - (Explore more advanced heuristics or metaheuristics (e.g., genetic algorithms, tabu
    search).)
  - Optimize existing algorithms for better performance or lower computational cost.
    - Doubling then Binary Search for BSI
- **Broader Problem Scope:**
  - Investigate scheduling with global precedence constraints.
  - Consider variable processing times or machine-specific constraints.
- **Real-World Applications:**
  - Apply algorithms to real datasets from industry.
  - Assess practical feasibility and effectiveness.
- **Scalability Enhancements:**
  - Develop parallel implementations to handle larger instances.
  - Use approximation schemes for faster computation.
- **Addressing Limitations:**
  - Acknowledge limitations in the current study (e.g., scope of instance types, computational
    resources).
  - Propose methodologies to overcome these challenges in future research.
